Thus, with a determination to devote His entire life to the service of mankind, Swami Debananda Maharaj left His home at the age of seventeen, and embarked on the journey of an ascetic.",
        "maharaj_p3": "Thus, as a Naga Sanyasin, His Holiness, Swami Debananda Maharaj spent fifteen years travelling across India from one place to another until He arrived in a small village called Gowalpara in the Hooghly district of West Bengal. He stayed there for days and soon people started thronging about Him to seek His blessings. Eventually, He started discoursing in the evenings before an ever-increasing group of devotees. In no time a shelter was built and that became His first ashram, set up in 1989.",
